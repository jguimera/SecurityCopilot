foundation API contains the data which includes autonomous system Information (AS Info), tags, Insights
etc. Based on various IPs the data list includes the critical information regarding each IP. 
Based on Insights, users can find the IP rating such as suspicious etc. Insights appear on an IP address's summary view and offer useful information at a glance such as:

1. Combinations of malicious tags
2. Suspicious activities
3. Peculiar domains
4. Recently expired domain records

Insights are sorted by rank of descending maliciousness (malicious, suspicious, followed by informational). 
The overall rating of the IP is determined by the most malicious insight. A maximum of ten insights are shown per IP Address searched.

"
"Pure_Signal_Scout",ScoutIPDetailsAPI,"Provide IP information such as identity, communication (comms), passive DNS, open ports, x.509 certificate, fingerprints, WHOIS and summary

The  IP detail endpoint allows users to retrieve a comprehensive report about a specific IP address. The report includes detailed information about the IP address's communication history, including open ports, protocols, and associated domains. 
Users can get the IP address's X.509 certificates, fingerprints, and associated whois data. 
By specifying the start and end dates for the response, users can gain insights into the IP address's relationships with specific times. 
Additionally, users can specify the number of days for which the report should be generated, allowing them to analyze the IP address's history in more detail.
Scout is a threat investigation and hunting platform used to identify and track malicious infrastructure on the internet. By using the IP detail endpoint the user can find the following things about the IP address.

The details page separates information about a searched IP Address into various sections.
Summary: The summary section shows summary information for the queried IP Address.
Communication (Comms): The communications section contains aggregated network traffic information for the queried IP Address.
Open Ports: The open ports section contains open port banner information obtained from devices connected to the Internet. This data is continuously updated as multiple servers scan IP address ranges for open ports and attempt to retrieve information on the service it is advertising. The banner field can contain items like the returned web server header, SSH banner or X.509 PEM certificate and the service field may contain the identified service tied to the banner (ssh, HTTP).
PDNS: The Passive Domain Name System (PDNS) section contains Passive DNS resource records returned by public DNS servers. The Passive Domain Name System (PDNS) dataset contains many different record types. It can be used to establish which A records have been observed for a domain of interest, which name servers have been tied to a certain domain and which MX (mail server) or SOA records are known. These records are collected by passive monitoring of DNS query responses.
X.509: The X.509 section contains information on public key infrastructure (PKI) digital certificates collected through active probing of devices running SSL on public IP addresses.
Fingerprints: The fingerprints section tab contains the three possible fingerprint hash values are JA3, JA3S, and JARM. The JA3 fingerprint dataset contains passive a TLS (and predecessor SSL) fingerprint for the client (JA3) and a fingerprint for the server (JA3S). This dataset can be used to identify the likely application used by the client and server, as well as identify IP addresses of command and control servers that use a distinctive JA3 fingerprint. The JARM fingerprint dataset contains active/scanning of candidate IP addresses and the resultant TLS session negotiation between the client and server. When the scan initiates 10 TLS Client Hello packets a candidate IP address and captures specific attributes of the TLS Server Hello responses a TLS session. During the handshake, the client shares the TLS libraries/methods it supports. The server shares which libraries/methods it supports. The TLS negotiations are exchanged in clear text, allowing the supported libraries to identify likely applications used by the client and server. The distinct IPs column indicates we have observed the fingerprint hash on the following number of IPs during the search period.
Whois: The whois section shows Whois information for the IP Address.

Darktrace,GetIncidentGroups,"An AI Analyst group serves as a container for an incident.

Groups have an identifier called ""groupid"" that starts with the 'g' character (e.g., g04a3f36e-4u8w-v9dh-x6lb-894778cf9633) and is 37 characters long. Groups consist of events, each with a unique ""uuid"" identifier, one of which will always be the ""groupid"" without the 'g' at the beginning (e.g., 04a3f36e-4u8w-v9dh-x6lb-894778cf9633).

AI Analyst incidents are an excellent starting point for threat hunting or identifying active threats, as their purpose is to autonomously investigate lower-level alerts, anomalies, and unusual behavior.

**Note:** The timestamps and groupid provided in the examples are for illustration purposes only. Replace them with the appropriate timestamps and groupid based on your specific requirements.

To create a search request, follow these steps:

1) Calculate the dtimeFrom and dtimeTo UTC timestamps (yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ), make sure these are set to the desired time range. Default dtimeFrom to the current timestamp.
2) Create the query object, this should be a json object. The value must be formatted as a valid object enclosed within curly braces {...} so that the endpoint can directly index into it.
2a) Ensure the criteriaList items are correct and the mode is speciifed
3) Combine everything together the page and itemsPerPage count, keep in mind you may need to iterate if more than 20 emails are found."

forescoutrem,"get_rem_assets","Retrieves a list of all REM Assets and their related properties. These properties include a risk score and any associated events impacting that score, as well as a risk severity and device criticality. Risk indicators include exposed services and confguration findings, with the exposed services having the service name, port/protocol and the potential exposure from that service. Configuration findings provide a description, severity, timestamp along with running application name, source, compliance status and any other relevant information for that finding. An overall compliance status is provided along with policy, rule name and status of individual compliance policies that feed this status.
A list of threats for a host is also returned with a threat name, description, status and if relevant a case number and the creation time. Network interface information with Mac and/or IP is provided. Where available, network access information is also provided to help locate the host on a wired or wireless network, including switch and switch port information, vlan information, wireless AP and SSID information, and 802.1x information to name a few. In addition, an extensive amount of other host information is provided if available within Forescout, which includes, but is not limited to, running services and processes, installed applications, hostname, domain name, open ports, VPN user details and IP, user name, title, department, email, and device function, vendor, operating system and model.
For medical or operational technology devices, further relevant host information is provided specific to those device types, such as purdue level, or medical device function. This also provides a list of Forescout eyeSight related properties such as segment name, path and group memberships.
This path has 4 required parameters, the Start and End parameters should always be formatted in iso_utc time, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ, while the Sort Order can be either ASCENDING or DESCENDING. The Order By parameter can be any of the values returned by this API, as defined in the schema. When none of these have been defined, the default should be to look at the last 7 days and sort by risk_score DESCENDING
Whenever any information is returned to a user, you **should always** include either hostname, IP address or MAC address so that further queries can be made for a specific host.
Whenever returning multiple devices in a response, you **should always** identify the device by IP address.
Unless a user specifically asks otherwise, whenever providing events or a timeline, you **should always** explain this from the time of an incident going backwards
